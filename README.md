## TRAINING

### Why Everyone Should Do Strength Training
Strength/resistance training are sometimes misunderstood by people who are unfamiliar with it. This type of training is not just for powerlifters and bodybuilders. Gaining strength and muscle have numerous health and lifestyle benefits. For well rounded fitness pursuits, it’s a very good idea to do some strength training even if it’s not your primary focus. Here are some of the benefits:

* Improved ability to manipulate / move objects in day-to-day life, including yourself
* Increased bone density and reduced risk of osteoporosis
* Improved balance and reduced risk of falls
* Can reduce symptoms of arthritis, back pain, obesity, heart disease, depression, and diabetes
* Can improve cognitive ability in older adults
* Can improve blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and HDL
* Can reduce risk of cancer
* Broadly reduces risk of injury
* Can help maintain joint flexibility
* Improved ability to control weight gain through increased calorie usage

### Why Everyone Should Do Cardio
Like strength training, cardiovascular exercise is an important component of a well rounded fitness pursuit and has numerous health benefits. Some of the benefits of doing cardio include:

* Improved heart and lung health
* Improved heart rate
* Improved recovery from strenuous activities and workouts
* Potentially reduced risk of dementia
* Improved immune system function
* May improve cholesterol levels
* May help prevent or manage diabetes
* May improve gut health
* May improve mental health and mood

### Keep it simple Don't overthink it or get overwhelmed by the huge amount of information online. Most people overcomplicate workouts and diet. Focus on a few compound movements, and a few healthy food groups that provide the most benefits.

### There are many workout terms out there, most don't actually mean anything
e.g. there's no such think as "toning". Only worry about two things:
1. building muscle (strengh training and diet) and
2. burning fat (cardio training and diet)

### The most important factors in achieving fitness goals are:
* Doing an appropriate amount of exercise at an appropriate intensity
* Having some form of progression over time in your training regimen
* Eating an appropriate amount of calories and protein
* Getting enough sleep, rest, and recovery time
* Consistency over time in all of the above

All other factors – including taking supplements – will have extremely minimal impact on your success. It is important to put the majority of your focus on dialing these five factors.

### Don't exercise, _train_
This means don't just do random workouts or movements. Create a plan, and stick to it.

### Don't depend on motivation
Motivation means you have to be in a certain mood or mindset to do something. Training should be best on discipline. Make it a habit, something you just have to do.

### Change takes time
Don't expect immediate results. Complete beginners can _maybe_ expect to see results after two weeks on consistent training and diet. Weight loss target should be roughly 1 lb per week (52 lbs per year), muscle gain target should be roughly 0.5 lbs per week (26 lbs per year).

### Make goals and keep track of your progress
You should be training towards something. A certain weight, amount of reps, hold duration, etc. "I want to be healthy" is not a goal. Goals are measurable and can be checked off.

How much can you bench, squat and deadlift? How many chin-ups? You need to be able to answer those questions. Whether it’s a set of 1, 4, 6 or 8 reps doesn’t matter. Keep track of concrete reference points in order to evaluate your progress. Not “in your head”, write it down. The single act of writing it down is more important than you think, whether you keep those data points in a notebook, on your computer or on Post-It notes.

### Remain consistent
Try to stick with one workout plan. The only thing that should be changing from week to week is the load you're on or the progression you're at, and the reps you did. If you’re doing it right, these should be increasing. Everything else stays the same; the movements and the order you did them in, the sets and the rest periods in between sets.

This is the only way you can fairly evaluate your progress and see if you’re headed in the right direction. It might sound tedious to keep doing the same movements every week and the appeal of “mixing it up” can seem strong.

### Cardio is important
Strength is strength. Cardio is cardio. Don’t mix, keep them separate.

### You need a good training routine, and good diet, and lots of rest
Training is where you damage the muscle fibers. This causes the body to rebuild the muscle fibers stronger and bigger. Recovery (NOT training) is when the muscles are rebuilt. You need good quality sleep to rebuild muscle. The body uses your diet to rebuild the muscle fiber. A bad diet doesn't give the body anything to rebuild with.

### Learn good form from the start
It's much better to do one perfect pushup than five imperfect ones.

## WORKOUT ROUTINE

> squats, deadlifts, bench presses, chin-ups, triceps extensions and calf raises

## NUTRITION

### A diet is not a temporary change, it's a lifestyle change
This doesn't mean radically changing what you eat and being unhappy.

### You cannot out-train a bad diet
You can eat 100 calories in a second. Burning 100 calories take much more effort.

### Understand calories
Your body requires a certain amount of energy (measured in calories) each day in order to fuel its activities. This is called your Total Daily Energy Expenditure or TDEE. If your diet supplies fewer calories than your TDEE (a deficit), you will lose weight. If your diet supplies more calories than your TDEE (a surplus), you will gain weight. Eat 10-20% fewer calories to lose weight, eat 10-20% more calories to gain weight. One pound of bodyweight is 3500 calories.

You don’t necessarily need to dive in to meticulous tracking of calories and food to start – in fact, sometimes doing so can be overwhelming and therefore detrimental. However, if you’re having trouble gaining or losing the weight you want over a period of time, at some point you’re probably going to have to start paying attention to and manipulating your caloric balance.

### Eat protein
What matters most after calories is protein. It’s important to ensure that you eat enough protein each day to fuel the process of building muscle. To maximize the benefit for building muscle, you’ll want to consume roughly 1g of protein for every pound you weight per day (i.e. if you weight 140lbs, aim to eat 140g of protein per day).

### There's no perfect diet
There are many dietary strategies and they can all work, so follow whichever one is easiest for you to stick with – because it’s really all about calories, protein, and just generally eating well.

### Recommendations to gain or lose weight:
**1. Take your “before” measurements.**
These can be any measurements you want, but should at least include weight and photos of front, back, and side (in underwear is ideal).

**2. Estimate your TDEE.**
Remember to treat this as an estimate only, and keep in mind the adage “No plan survives engagement with the enemy”. Expect to have to adjust this number over time.

**3. Set a daily calorie goal.**
The best place to start is by increasing your TDEE by 10-20% (TDEE x 1.1-1.2) or reducing your TDEE by 10-20% (TDEE x 0.9-0.8). You will usually want to avoid going above/under 20% more/less than your TDEE. Going too far above your TDEE will lead to increased fat gain, and could make it very difficult to eat enough food without discomfort. Muscle builds very slowly, so don’t think that more food always = more muscle. Going too far below your TDEE will the increase likelihood of malnourishment, muscle loss, low energy, inadequate fat intake for hormonal balance, and cycles of restriction followed by binge eating.

**4. Set a daily protein goal.**
Shoot for a roughly 1g of protein for every pound you weight per day (i.e. if you weight 140lbs, aim to eat 140g of protein per day).

**5. Track your calorie and protein consumption.**
Tools such as https://www.myfitnesspal.com/ are very useful for tracking calories. Track everything you eat and drink, including additives and toppings.

**6. Take regular progress measurements.**
Weight should generally be measured once a week, preferably unclothed and on an empty stomach. Don’t sweat day-to-day fluctuations – track the trend over time. Monthly progress photos may be worth considering.

**7. Adjust your diet over time.**
As you gain weight, your TDEE will inevitably go up – more mass requires more calories to fuel. This means that your starting calorie goal will eventually no longer cause weight gain, and you will need to adjust it up. As you lose weight, your TDEE will inevitably go down – less mass requires fewer calories to fuel. This means that your starting calorie goal will eventually no longer cause weight loss, and you will need to adjust it down.

**8. Be patient and do not expect progress to be fast**
While you can gain weight pretty quickly, gaining actual muscle is a different story. You should not expect to gain more than ~2 lbs of pure muscle per month. Additionally, you should not expect to start seeing visual changes for at least the first month, and no noticeable changes for at least the first 2-3 months. Don’t let this discourage you.

**9. Expect to be hungry (weight loss)**
Expect to be hungry. You may not be used to feeling hungry often, or even at all, but when you start eating less food than your body is used to and wants, hunger is something you need to expect and be willing to deal with. It’s possible you’ll be able to reduce or eliminate feelings of hunger through changes in what you’re eating, but it’s just as possible that you won’t. Hunger is normal when eating at a calorie deficit, and you can’t let it trip you up.
