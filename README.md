### Keep it simple
When it comes to strength training, the right choices are limited and uncomplicated. There are right and wrong ways to do things, not “it depends”. 
Don't overthink it. Simpler is better. Don't get overwhelmed by the huge amount of information online.

### Don't exercise, _train_.
This means don't just do random workouts or movements. Create a plan, and stick to it.

### Keep track of your progress.
How much can you bench, squat and deadlift? How many chin-ups? You need to be able to answer those questions. Whether it’s a set of 1, 4, 6 or 8 reps doesn’t matter. You need to have concrete reference points in order to evaluate your progress. Keep track of them in a training log. Not “in your head”, write it down. The single act of writing it down is more important than you think, whether you keep those data points in a notebook, on your computer or on Post-It notes like me.

With tracking comes the motivation to train, the results and everything else. I can’t even imagine where people get their motivation from if they don’t keep track and just choose weights/progressions at random based on whatever feels good that day.

### Remain consistent
The only thing that should be changing from week to week is the load on the bar or the progression you're at, and the reps with the same load you used last time. If you’re doing it right, these should be increasing. Everything else stays the same; the movements and the order you did them in, the sets and the rest periods in between sets. You don’t add in new stuff.

This is the only way you can fairly evaluate your progress and see if you’re headed in the right direction. It might sound tedious to keep doing the same movements every week and the appeal of “mixing it up” can seem strong.
