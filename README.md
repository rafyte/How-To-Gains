## Keep it simple
### When it comes to strength training, the right choices are limited and uncomplicated. There are right and wrong ways to do things, not “it depends”. 
### Don't overthink it. When it comes to diet and training, simpler is better. Don't get overwhelmed by the huge amount of information online.

## Don't exercise, _train_.
### Keep track of your progress.
How much can you bench, squat and deadlift? How many chin-ups? You need to be able to answer those questions right now. Don’t let me hear “I THINK I can” or “I’m not sure but…”. You need to know how much weight you can maximally lift in one set when you’re fresh.

Whether it’s a set of 1, 4 ,6 or 8 reps doesn’t matter. You need to have concrete reference points in order to evaluate your progress. Keep track of them in a training log. Not “in your head”, write it down. The single act of writing it down is more important than you think, whether you keep those data points in a notebook, on your computer or on Post-It notes like me.

With tracking comes the motivation to train, the results and everything else. I can’t even imagine where people get their motivation from if they don’t keep track and just choose weights at random based on whatever feels good that day.

You should at all times be aware of the best performance in a few key lifts, your body weight and the conditions under which those sets were performed.
