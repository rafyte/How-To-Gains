# üí™ TRAINING

### Why Everyone Should Do Strength Training
Strength/resistance training are sometimes misunderstood by people who are unfamiliar with it. This type of training is not just for powerlifters and bodybuilders. Gaining strength and muscle have numerous health and lifestyle benefits. For well rounded fitness pursuits, it‚Äôs a very good idea to do some strength training even if it‚Äôs not your primary focus. Here are some of the benefits:

* Improved ability to manipulate / move objects in day-to-day life, including yourself
* Increased bone density and reduced risk of osteoporosis
* Improved balance and reduced risk of falls
* Can reduce symptoms of arthritis, back pain, obesity, heart disease, depression, and diabetes
* Can improve cognitive ability in older adults
* Can improve blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and HDL
* Can reduce risk of cancer
* Broadly reduces risk of injury
* Can help maintain joint flexibility
* Improved ability to control weight gain through increased calorie usage

### Why Everyone Should Do Cardio
Like strength training, cardiovascular exercise is an important component of a well rounded fitness pursuit and has numerous health benefits. Some of the benefits of doing cardio include:

* Improved heart and lung health
* Improved heart rate
* Improved recovery from strenuous activities and workouts
* Potentially reduced risk of dementia
* Improved immune system function
* May improve cholesterol levels
* May help prevent or manage diabetes
* May improve gut health
* May improve mental health and mood

### Keep it simple. Don't overthink it or get overwhelmed by the huge amount of information online. Most people overcomplicate workouts and diet. Focus on a few compound movements, and a few healthy food groups that provide the most benefits.

### There are many workout terms out there, most don't actually mean anything
e.g. there's no such think as "toning". Only worry about two things:
1. building muscle
2. burning fat

### The most important factors in achieving fitness goals are:
* Doing an appropriate amount of exercise at an appropriate intensity
* Having some form of progression over time in your training regimen
* Eating an appropriate amount of calories and protein
* Getting enough sleep, rest, and recovery time
* Consistency over time in all of the above

All other factors ‚Äì including taking supplements ‚Äì will have extremely minimal impact on your success. It is important to put the majority of your focus on dialing these five factors.

### Don't exercise, _train_
This means don't just do random workouts or movements. Create a plan, and stick to it.

### Don't depend on motivation
Motivation means you have to be in a certain mood or mindset to do something. Training should be best on discipline. Make it a habit, something you just have to do.

### Change takes time
Don't expect immediate results. Complete beginners can _maybe_ expect to see results after two weeks on consistent training and diet. Weight loss target should be roughly 1 lb per week (52 lbs per year), muscle gain target should be roughly 0.5 lbs per week (26 lbs per year).

### Make goals and keep track of your progress
You should be training towards something. A certain weight, amount of reps, hold duration, etc. "I want to be healthy" is not a goal. Goals are measurable and can be checked off.

How much can you bench, squat and deadlift? How many chin-ups? You need to be able to answer those questions. Whether it‚Äôs a set of 1, 4, 6 or 8 reps doesn‚Äôt matter. Keep track of concrete reference points in order to evaluate your progress. Not ‚Äúin your head‚Äù, write it down. The single act of writing it down is more important than you think, whether you keep those data points in a notebook, on your computer or on Post-It notes.

### Remain consistent
Try to stick with one workout plan. The only thing that should be changing from week to week is the load you're on or the progression you're at, and the reps you did. If you‚Äôre doing it right, these should be increasing. Everything else stays the same; the movements and the order you did them in, the sets and the rest periods in between sets.

This is the only way you can fairly evaluate your progress and see if you‚Äôre headed in the right direction. It might sound tedious to keep doing the same movements every week and the appeal of ‚Äúmixing it up‚Äù can seem strong.

### Cardio is important
Strength is strength. Cardio is cardio. Don‚Äôt mix, keep them separate.

### You need a good training routine, and good diet, and lots of rest
Training is when you damage the muscle fibers. This causes the body to rebuild the muscle fibers stronger and bigger. Recovery is when the muscles are rebuilt; you need good quality sleep to rebuild muscle. Your diet is what your body uses to rebuild the muscle fiber. A bad diet doesn't give the body anything to rebuild with.

### Learn good form from the start
It's much better to do one perfect pushup than five imperfect ones.

## WORKOUT ROUTINES

There is no one perfect routine, there are many ways to achieve your goals. Effort and consistency over time in both training and eating in accordance with your goals are more important than what specific routine you choose.

The most important factors to consider are these:
* If you have access to all of the equipment that the routine requires, or can make reasonable substitutions
* If you can handle the time investment the routine requires ‚Äì in session time, number of days per week, and schedule layout

Workout routines can be broken down into:
* Mobility / Flexibility
* Cardio
  * Low-Intesity Steady State (LISS)
  * High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
* Strength
  * Calisthenics / Bodyweight
  * Weightlifting
  
### Mobility / Flexibility
Mobility is essential in order to increase range of motion and reduce chance of injury. I personally do not have a dedicated mobility workout, but instead incorporate mobility during the warm up to a cardio or strength training routine.
Here's a list of routines you can choose from: <https://thefitness.wiki/routines/flexibility-mobility/>

### Cardio
Cardio is based on elevating your heart rate, and maintaining an elevated heart rate for a duration of time. 

If your goal is not to lose weight, you can keep cardio sessions to once per week.
Here's a list of routines you can choose from: <https://thefitness.wiki/routines/cardio-and-conditioning/>
Some recommendations:
* [Couch to 5k](https://runmoreapp.com/couch-to-5k) is a great running program (LISS)
* [8-Week HIIT](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/ultimate-8-week-hiit-for-fat-burning-program.html) is a great HIIT progam

### Strength Training
These routines should be made up of a few compound exercises consisting of pulling and pushing movements for upper and lower body. Compound is much better than isolation, especially for beginners, for several reasons:
* They do a much better job of stimulating overall muscle growth and development than isolation movements.
* They allow you to work out more efficiently. You can hit every major muscle group with a small number of exercises.
* They more closely resemble ways you will exert your body in real life. They are better at producing practical, useful strength.

You should only be able to perform a few reps of an exercise when strength training. Doing 50 half-pushups will accomplish nothing. The goal is NOT to perform as many reps as you can. The goal is to perform an exercise that is difficult to the point where you can only do 1-12 reps with perfect form before failure. If you can do 12 perfect-form reps of an exercise, it's time to add weight or move to next bodyweight progression.

Here's a list of various barbell, dumbbell, or bodyweight routines you can choose from: <https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/>

All good bodyweight workouts are very similar to each other, and all good weightlifting workouts are very similar to each other because they both focus on the fundamental compound movements.

My focus is on calisthenic training. Great beginner ones are:
* [/r/bodyweightfitness Recommended Routine](https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine)
* [Start Bodyweight](http://www.startbodyweight.com/p/start-bodyweight-basic-routine.html)
* [Chris Heria's Start Calisthenics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIVxdIWy7Eo)
  * [Pullups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB3X4TjTIes&t=2s)
  * [Pushups & Dips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdISLQcG8BA&t=4s)
  * [L-Sit & Pistol Squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flQVCWBuVgk)
  
My personal workout routine is derived from the above programs.

### My Workout
You cannot adjust the difficulty of bodyweight exercises like with weight training by simply adding or removing plates of weight. Therefore, in order to effectively increase or decrease the difficulty, you need to use different variations, or "progressions" of a type of exercise. My program is similar to Chris Heria's in that it's based on moving down progressions of an exercise after failure. The method is described clearly in his Pullup video above.

My training program is broken down into 3 different strenght training routines (`Pull`, `Push`, `Legs & Core`), plus an occasional cardio routine.

Perform warmup. Each warmup exercise should be roughly 10 reps.

For each exercise:
1. Find the progression you are at. If you cannot perform more than 12 perfect-form reps of a progression, that is the progression you're at.
2. Perform your highest progression until failure.
3. Immediately move to one progression below and perform until failure. For example, if you reach failure at 5 pullups, immediately start negative pullups until failure.
4. Immediately move to another progression down (two below highest progression) and perform until failure.
5. Rest for 2.5 to 3 minutes before next set.
6. Perform 3 sets of each exercise in this manner.
7. Rest for 2.5 to 3 minutes before moving on to next exercise.

Once you can perform 12 perfect-reps of a progression (or hold for 20 seconds, if it's a hold) for 3 sets, move to the next progression up when you do your next workout. If you can perform 12 perfect-reps of the highest progression, it's time to add weights.

Perform each rep of each exercises slowly and controlled. The idea is to keep the muscles under tension for as long as possible. For example, for jump squats, don't just do quick half-jumps; that's just cardio. Land softly and controlled into a full deep squat, all the way down, and explode upwards into a jump. Prioritize perfec-form from the start.

Make sure to perform full range of motion. For example, for a pushup you should practically touch the floor and extend completely for every rep.

`Pull` workout time: ~35 mins. `Push` workout time: ~55 mins. `Legs & Core` workout time: ~45 mins.

# üçú NUTRITION

### A diet is not a temporary change
A diet is what you eat day to day, throughout your life. Not something you follow for a short period of time. You must be willing to treat this as a change to your lifestyle.

### You cannot out-train a bad diet
You can eat 100 calories in a second. Burning 100 calories take much more effort. It does not matter how consistent and hard you train, if you have a bad diet you will not lose fat. It does not matter how consistent and hard you train, if you have a bad diet you will not build muscle.

### Understand calories
Your body requires a certain amount of energy (measured in calories) each day in order to fuel its activities. This is called your Total Daily Energy Expenditure or TDEE.
* If eat fewer calories than your TDEE (a deficit), you will lose weight.
* If eat more calories than your TDEE (a surplus), you will gain weight.

Eat 10-20% fewer calories than your TDEE to healthily lose weight, eat 10-20% more calories than your TDEE to healthily gain weight. One pound of bodyweight is 3500 calories.

You don‚Äôt need to obsess over tracking calories and food to start ‚Äì in fact, sometimes doing so can be overwhelming and therefore detrimental. However, if you‚Äôre having trouble gaining or losing the weight you want over a period of time, at some point you‚Äôre probably going to have to start paying attention to and manipulating your caloric balance.

### Eat protein
What matters most after calories is protein. It‚Äôs important to ensure that you eat enough protein each day to fuel the process of building muscle. To maximize the benefit for building muscle, you‚Äôll want to consume roughly 1g of protein for every pound you weight per day (i.e. if you weight 140lbs, aim to eat at least 140g of protein per day).

Focus on calories and protein. Tracking macro/micronutrients and taking supplements is unneccessary for most people. The only exception is protein supplement, if you need help reaching protein intake goals. Best protein supplements can be found here: <https://labdoor.com/rankings/protein?filter=quality>

### There's no perfect diet
There are many dietary strategies and they can all work, so follow whichever one is easiest for you to stick with ‚Äì because it‚Äôs really all about calories, protein, and just generally eating well.

### Recommendations to gain or lose weight:
**1. Take your ‚Äúbefore‚Äù measurements.**
These can be any measurements you want, but should at least include weight and photos of front, back, and side (in underwear is ideal).

**2. Estimate your TDEE.**
Remember to treat this as an estimate only, and keep in mind the adage ‚ÄúNo plan survives engagement with the enemy‚Äù. Expect to have to adjust this number over time.

**3. Set a daily calorie goal.**
The best place to start is by increasing your TDEE by 10-20% (TDEE x 1.1-1.2) or reducing your TDEE by 10-20% (TDEE x 0.9-0.8). You will usually want to avoid going above/under 20% more/less than your TDEE. Going too far above your TDEE will lead to increased fat gain, and could make it very difficult to eat enough food without discomfort. Muscle builds very slowly, so don‚Äôt think that more food always = more muscle. Going too far below your TDEE will the increase likelihood of malnourishment, muscle loss, low energy, inadequate fat intake for hormonal balance, and cycles of restriction followed by binge eating.

**4. Set a daily protein goal.**
Shoot for a roughly 1g of protein for every pound you weight per day (i.e. if you weight 140lbs, aim to eat 140g of protein per day).

**5. Track your calorie and protein consumption.**
Tools such as https://www.myfitnesspal.com/ are very useful for tracking calories. Track everything you eat and drink, including additives and toppings.

**6. Take regular progress measurements.**
Weight should generally be measured once a week, preferably unclothed and on an empty stomach. Don‚Äôt sweat day-to-day fluctuations ‚Äì track the trend over time. Monthly progress photos may be worth considering.

**7. Adjust your diet over time.**
As you gain weight, your TDEE will inevitably go up ‚Äì more mass requires more calories to fuel. This means that your starting calorie goal will eventually no longer cause weight gain, and you will need to adjust it up. As you lose weight, your TDEE will inevitably go down ‚Äì less mass requires fewer calories to fuel. This means that your starting calorie goal will eventually no longer cause weight loss, and you will need to adjust it down.

**8. Be patient and do not expect progress to be fast**
While you can gain weight pretty quickly, gaining actual muscle is a different story. You should not expect to gain more than ~2 lbs of pure muscle per month. Additionally, you should not expect to start seeing visual changes for at least the first month, and no noticeable changes for at least the first 2-3 months. Don‚Äôt let this discourage you.

**9. Expect to be hungry (weight loss)**
Expect to be hungry. You may not be used to feeling hungry often, or even at all, but when you start eating less food than your body is used to and wants, hunger is something you need to expect and be willing to deal with. It‚Äôs possible you‚Äôll be able to reduce or eliminate feelings of hunger through changes in what you‚Äôre eating, but it‚Äôs just as possible that you won‚Äôt. Hunger is normal when eating at a calorie deficit, and you can‚Äôt let it trip you up.
