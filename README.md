### Why Everyone Should Do Strength Training
Strength training (most commonly lifting weight) are sometimes misunderstood by people who are unfamiliar with it. This type of training is not just for powerlifters and bodybuilders, or people who want to get “jacked”. Gaining strength and muscle have numerous health and lifestyle benefits. For well rounded fitness pursuits, it’s a very good idea to do some strength training even if it’s not your primary focus. Here are some of the benefits:

* Improved ability to manipulate / move objects in day-to-day life, including yourself
* Increased bone density and reduced risk of osteoporosis
* Improved balance and reduced risk of falls
* Can reduce symptoms of arthritis, back pain, obesity, heart disease, depression, and diabetes
* Can improve cognitive ability in older adults
* Can improve blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and HDL
* Can reduce risk of cancer
* Broadly reduces risk of injury
* Can help maintain joint flexibility
* Improved ability to control weight gain through increased calorie usage

### Why Everyone Should Do Cardio
Like strength training, cardiovascular exercise is an important component of a well rounded fitness pursuit and has numerous health benefits. Avoiding cardio can even hold your strength training back.
Some of the benefits of doing cardio include:

* Improved heart and lung health
* Improved heart rate
* Improved recovery from strenuous activities and workouts
* Potentially reduced risk of dementia
* Improved immune system function
* May improve cholesterol levels
* May help prevent or manage diabetes
* May improve gut health
* May improve mental health and mood

### Keep it simple.
The right choices are limited and uncomplicated. There are right and wrong ways to do things, not “it depends”. 
Don't overthink it. Simpler is better. Don't get overwhelmed by the huge amount of information online.
Most people overcomplicate workouts and diet. Focus on a few compound movements, and a few healthy food groups that provide the most benefits. Don't worry about taking supplements, they don't compensate for a lack of effort, a bad training routine, or a bad diet.

There are many workout terms out there, most don't actually mean anything. There's no such think as "toning". Only worry about two things:
1. building muscle (strengh training and diet) and
2. burning fat (cardio training and diet)

The most important factors in achieving fitness goals are:

* Doing an appropriate amount of exercise at an appropriate intensity
* Having some form of progression over time in your training regimen
* Eating an appropriate amount of calories and protein
* Getting enough sleep, rest, and recovery time
* Consistency over time in all of the above

All other factors – including and especially commercially available supplements – will have extremely minimal impact on your success. It is important to put the majority of your focus on dialing these five factors. Not only is it a better use of your time and energy, but keeping the amount of change in your life small will make it less stressful and easier to sustain.

### Don't exercise, _train_.
This means don't just do random workouts or movements. Create a plan, and stick to it.

### Don't depend on motivation.
Motivation means you have to be in a certain mood or mindset to do something. Training should be best on discipline. Make it a habit, something you just have to do.

### Change takes time.
Don't expect immediate results. Complete beginners can expect to see results after two weeks on consistent training and diet. Weight loss target should be roughly 1 lb per week (52 lbs per year), muscle gain target should be roughly 0.5 lbs per week (26 lbs per year).

### Make goals.
You should be training towards something. A certain weight, amount of reps, hold duration, etc. "I want to be healthy" is not a goal. Goals are measurable and can be checked off.

### Keep track of your progress.
How much can you bench, squat and deadlift? How many chin-ups? You need to be able to answer those questions. Whether it’s a set of 1, 4, 6 or 8 reps doesn’t matter. Keep track of concrete reference points in order to evaluate your progress. Not “in your head”, write it down. The single act of writing it down is more important than you think, whether you keep those data points in a notebook, on your computer or on Post-It notes.

With tracking comes the motivation to train, the results and everything else. I can’t even imagine where people get their motivation from if they don’t keep track their progress.

### Remain consistent
The only thing that should be changing from week to week is the load on the bar or the progression you're at, and the reps with the same load you used last time. If you’re doing it right, these should be increasing. Everything else stays the same; the movements and the order you did them in, the sets and the rest periods in between sets. You don’t add in new stuff.

This is the only way you can fairly evaluate your progress and see if you’re headed in the right direction. It might sound tedious to keep doing the same movements every week and the appeal of “mixing it up” can seem strong.

### Cardio is important
Strength is strength. Cardio is cardio. Don’t mix, keep them separate.

### You need a good training routine, and good diet, and lots of rest.
Training is where you damage the muscle fibers. This causes the body to rebuild the muscle fibers stronger and bigger. Recovery (NOT training) is when the muscles are rebuilt. You need good quality sleep to rebuild muscle. The body uses your diet to rebuild the muscle fiber. A bad diet doesn't give the body anything to rebuild with.

### Learn good form from the start.

## WORKOUT ROUTINE

> built my physique with these movements primarily: squats, deadlifts, bench presses, chin-ups, triceps extensions and calf raises. These have remained staples throughout the years. I have flirted with other movements, but these were brief periods. On the whole, that’s one movement per muscle group, with the exception of abs and biceps, which I never really trained except for early in my training career, and then very sporadically every once in a while.

## DIET

A diet is not a temporary change, it's a lifestyle change.

You cannot out-train a bad diet.

One pound is 3500 calories.
